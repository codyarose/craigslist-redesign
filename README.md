# craigslist-redesign
>>This is a responsive redesign of the boring, bland Craigslist "home" page. I've placed most of the category clutter into the sidebar, which would be present on every page making navigation to any category very simple. To fill the empty space created by putting everything in the sidebar I've embedded a Google Map focused on the selected city (Knoxville, TN in this case) with some modifications to match the style of the redesign by way of Snazzy Maps.

#### Tools Used
- Bootstrap 4.0
- jQuery
- CSS3
- HTML5
